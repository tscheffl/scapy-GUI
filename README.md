# scapy-gui-ipv6 
## A graphical user interface for IPv6 Packet-generation with Scapy

----
### Version: 2.2
### Date:    23.11.2011     

----

##DESCRIPTION:

This tool provides a GUI for the Python network tool Scapy.

It serves as a learning tool for packet generation with Python and as a 
tool for rapid IPv6 packet generation.


##INSTALLATION:

You can simply download the current version from here: 
http://code.google.com/p/scapy-gui-ipv6/downloads/list

Unzip and run the included Python 'gui.py' script as root or 
using 'sudo'. Extended privileges are only required if the
GUI is used to actually send packets to the network. It can
be run by any non-priviledged users in order to build 
Scapy-code, or save the constructed packet in a pcap-file.


##PREREQUISITES

Scapy, Python and the QT4 runtime must be installed on the machine 
for program to run. You can download the latest version of Scapy 
here: http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/

For all options is the packet "python-pyx" necessary.


In order to send IPv6 packets to the network directly from the GUI, 
you must have full privileges on the machine. Start the program with


```bash
$ sudo python gui.py
```

or a similar command depending on your platform.
